1) Merge with Rotation-Invariant VAE
    i) Maybe this can be done by having the same structure and then solely changing the encoder part?

2) Try a PCA on the latent dimension
3) Or a valid t-SNE? Or kernel PCA?
4) Plotting - stratify on numbers to checkout reconstructions
5) (MAYBE:) Predictive property - how good can we train a classifier by
    i) applying a CNN to the MNIST problem?
    ii) training a model on the latent representations?
    iii) including the label, y, in the model input for modeling the joint probability of p(x,y)?
