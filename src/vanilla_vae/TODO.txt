1) Merge with Rotation-Invariant VAE
    i) Maybe this can be done by having the same structure and then solely changing the encoder part?

2) Train from checkpoint (load model from checkpoint and train (argument))

3) Try a PCA on the latent dimension
4) Or a valid t-SNE? Or kernel PCA?
5) (MAYBE:) Predictive property - how good can we train a classifier by
    i) applying a CNN to the MNIST problem?
    ii) training a model on the latent representations?
    iii) including the label, y, in the model input for modeling the joint probability of p(x,y)?
